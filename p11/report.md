# Program Ex 11: Display content of Structure

## Discussion

A structure (`struct`) is a user-defined datatype which is collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name. Syntax for definig a structure is as follows:  
```
struct structurename{
  datatype1 var1;
  datatype2 var2;
}
```
When a struct type is declared, no storage or memory is allocated. To allocate memory of a given structure type and work with it, we need to create variables. Syntax of it is as follows:  
```
struct structurename svar1, sver2, svar3;
```  
Here, there can be ant no. of variables having type `struct structurename`.  
To print/access members of the structure we need to use member operator which is (`.`) so, syntax to access member is like, `svar1.var1`, `svar1.var2`, `svar2.var1` etc.
