# Program Ex 01: Connect to Code Server

## Aim

Login to code.gndec.ac.in

## Discussion

A remote server is a server which is just on another computer rather being on the same comupter we are working on. So, we are said to be working remotely when we are working on a remote server. So, now  we need to connect to remote code server of GNDEC college, that is code.gndec.ac.in to do practicals on remote server. 
To connect to code.gndec.ac.in we need to install a remote terminal application and an example of it is Mosh which stands for Mobile Shell. Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS. It  allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.

## Procedure

1. Install Mosh in your operating system (OS). Check the procedure for your OS from this [link](https://mosh.org/#getting).
2. Open Mosh.
3. Enter college rollno. (eg: `2030025`) as Username and `code.gndec.ac.in` as hostname and ensure that Address family is IPv4 and SSH port is 22 and the rest be default.
4. Click connect. It will ask you to allow and save the fingerprint of your device. So, to allow, type 'yes' (Just type within the quotes)
5. Now, it will ask for password. So, type the password provided by college. (Password won't we visible but it is being typed).
6. Now, you are successfully connected to code.gndec.ac.in
 
### Lessons Learned:

1. What is remote server?
2. What is code server of GNDEC College?
3. What is Mosh?
4. How to connect to remote server?
